At my current job we have some projects that were realized using the **Go programming language**. The cool thing is, programmers that have used it are in love with it, and these applications never crash, not even under heavy load. This is great, for example, for applications that have to process a stream of data as fast as possible.

So, I decided to go through HackerRank and do the 30 days challenge. I do not expect to become a True ExpertÂ© but, at least, I'd like to catch up with the syntax and all the rest.

(Probably, in the long run, we're going to sunset these Go projects because we got acquired by another company, and their main programming language is Java, sooooo....)

I will not go through installing the go compiler, _Go figure out_ by yourself. But this hello world may give you (and me) a sense of what's going on here.

## On the educative task of explaining Hello World

When I was at university my Java teacher asked students to write the best-possible explanation of Java's Hello World, that would win a Java book (Java 1.4, I'm that old). So I wrote a 4 pages essay explaining _everything_ (keywords, exceptions...) and yes, I own that book now :)

This "exercise" is really valid and I encourage everyone to do it. You will do a lot of research to explain tiny details that usually do not seem to have much importance. So, for example, it took me 4-5 hours to write this article. The outcome is that I feel confident of what I learned.

## Things you should know before we write some code

**Go is a compiled programming language**. This means that to run your program you first need to compile it using the `go` executable.

Go source files have the `.go` extension. So, to compile a file:

```shell
$ go build hello-world.go 
$ ls 
hello-world hello-world.go 
```

Go compiler will create a `hello-world` executable that we can lunch, on Linux and Mac systems, by running `./hello-world` .

Some may say that it's boring to compile & launch so **Go offers the `run` mode, that will execute the two steps for you:**

```console
$ go run hello-world.go 
.... (program output here) 
```

And finally: **go has an official formatting tool**. This means that you cannot decide how many spaces (or tabs), or how long your lines should be, etc. Smart IDEs like Visual Studio Code with the Go extension will automagically run the formatting tool for you at every save. But if you want to run it from the command line:

```console
$ go fmt hello-world.go 
```

No more issues on git merge :)

## Let's go back to the source code

The exercise track:

> save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print `Hello, World.` on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

Here's the source code:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	var reader = bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
	message, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')

	fmt.Println("Hello, World.")
	fmt.Println(message)
}
```

Let's break up and analyse the code in parts.

### the package declaration

```go
package main
```

**All go code must declare its package.** Executable files must be in a `main` package, and the first function that is executed on the first run is the `main` function. 

### Import block

```go
import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)
```

Here, we are importing three packages from the go standard library:

* `fmt` is the [formatted I/O library](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/) and contains functions to read and write from I/O like printf and scanf in C.
* `bufio` is the package that will perform [buffered i/o operations](https://golang.org/pkg/bufio/). basically, we want to read a bunch of characters at a time, and this is the package that contains the easiest functions.
* `os` provides a [platform-independent interface](https://golang.org/pkg/os/) to operating system functionality.

I must be honest with you, in my first attempt to write this block, I wrote:

```go
import "fmt"
import "bufio"
import "os"
```

This is legal syntax, but the go formatter decided that wrapping all packages inside a single `import` declaration is better. If the formatter goes with the other syntax, it's probably better to use it from the start.

### function declarations

```go
func main() {
  ...
}
```

Another piece of syntax from go: to declare functions we write `func` followed by the function name. If the file must be executable, the function must be called `main()` and be in the `main` package.

You may ask, "_what is the syntax if I want to pass arguments? and return values?_" Ok, here's a slightly more complex example:

```go
func addMult(a,b int)(int, int) {
   return a+b, a*b
}
```

wtf? well, this means that this function accepts two parameters in input (`a` and `b`) and will return **two** values, that you can assign. We'll see an example in the next block.

### Read input from STDIN

```go
var reader = bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
message, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
```

Here we are declaring `reader` variable with `var` and `message` variable without `var`. Why?

To only declare a variable, without initializing, you can use the keyword `var` followed by the variable name; you must also declare a type.

If the type can be inferred by the assigning expression, it can be omitted.

If the variable is initialized and assigned in the same moment, Go offers the shorthand syntax via `:=` that allows to avoid the `var` keyword. So the first line may be written as:

```go
reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
```

As I specified before, the `bufio` library contains functions that allow to read in a buffer. The buffer we are creating is reading from STDIN, that is a common name for the Standard Input. Basically, what the user types in the terminal.

Once we get a reference to the `reader`, we use it to read a string using the method `ReadString()`. ReadString accepts a character (that is wrapped in single quotes, `''` instead of strings that use double quotes, `""`) that will be used to match the end of the buffer line.  But... what's on the left side of the assignment?

```go
message, _ := ...
```

We just hit our first multi-return function. ReadString returns two values, the data read and the error; we _should_ take care of the error variable (in Go, if you declare a variable and you will not use it, the program will not compile at all), but if we want to skip the variable assignment, we can simply set to `_` (underscore) and Go compiler will stop protesting. So, in a scenario like reading from a file or from the network, where obviously something may go wrong, skipping the error check is not a good idea. In this case, given the simplicity of the program, we take our responsibilities as grown adults.

### Writing to STDOUT

Outputting data is much simpler:

```go
fmt.Println("Hello, World.")
fmt.Println(message)
```

In this snippet, we are writing "Hello World" followed by the message we captured at the previous step. That's it. Program ended.

## Where is the power of Go?

You may not see it from this very simple program, but:

* being compiled, and strongly typed, many errors will be caught at compile time.
* multi-return values allow for the error-checking pattern that is verbose, but produces some very robust code.
* Go shines on multithreaded applications using "channels", more on that in the next articles. As I said, my colleagues wrote a super-fast data processor that never breaks, even under heavy load.

Below I leave some links that I checked while writing this article. Explore them like I did. Bye!
