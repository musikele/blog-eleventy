I've gone through many notetaking apps in my life, expecially the open source ones. For my job, a very simple notepad is simply not enough. Let's compare some of them I've used along the years.

- **Evernote**. Nice app, probably the first reall _premium_ one. The drawbacks for me are that it's commercial, it's not open source, it's a locked ecosystem. Tested for a while then I started checking out for alternatives.
- **Google Keep**. Very simple note taking app. For some time it has been my default app. However, it's very limited: I want to do much more with my knowledge.
- **DS Note - AKA Synology Note Station**. Synology is a NAS producer and I proudly own a [Synology NAS](/2019/10/27/tips-tricks-from-my-linux-experience.html) at home. I use many Synology services, like [Synology Photos](/from-google-photos-to-synology-photos/), because I want to physically own my data. Sometimes I may write a password, or some thoughs that I don't want to go public. HOWEVER, **DS Note** is probably the least loved app by Synology developers. There are a lot of bugs that you hit in a way or another. Plus, the data is not in an exportable format. And you cannot create links. Usability is a mess on mobile devices.
- **Obsidian**. This was my first attempt to use a serious app for note taking. With Obsidian, note taking becomes a true _knowledge tracing_ experience. I've used obsidian with a lot of profit over the last year, and there were a couple of features i really liked, like the fact that everything is Markdown (we should give the author of Markdown a Turing Award, lol), files are phisically living on your device, and you can sync with whatever - I sync with my NAS, for example, but others do with dropbox etc. Everything looks cool, but still I have found some shortcomings, like the fact that notes were mostly disconnected, and i kept organizing notes based on directories and subdirectories, which is not optimal.
- **Logseq** - the last tool I'm trying to use. It will be discussed later more in detail.

## My requirements

- **Files must be mine**. I don't want my notes to live on hardware that is not mine.
- **Markdown**. I want to use Markdown to write my notes. Markdown is a very simple way of writing notes with all the fancy stuff we are used to - bold, italics, tables, images, links, code... - and then it's nicely rendered as html by programs. Once you start using markdown it's impossible to go back.
- **Organize my knowledge**. This is where Obsidian starts to fall short. Obisidian uses a bottom-up approach, so you write the note, and then you connect the note with other pages, which may never happen. My notes were mostly disconnected with very few links.
- **Write Todo lists**, and possibily handle them as a kanban board. I keep juggling many tasks at once (I know it's bad but life is like that), so I need a place to capture what I am working on.
- **Have a journal of my day**. I was not int journaling, but the author of a newletter i am subscribed shared the idea of a "house journal", where he kept writing down things about his house, and his life: when he did renovations, who came to visit, etc. Porting the idea to the computer world, I started to feel the need of a place where I could write down what I was working on, what I was thinking, personal notes, etc.
- **Link all these thoughts with ease**. I want the process of linking stuff together to be totally transparent; i don't want to look for a filename or to phisically create the note; the program should take care of it.
- **search**. Given that it's plain text, this is probably the easiest part that every program is able to do.
