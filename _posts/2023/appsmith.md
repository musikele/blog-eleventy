Fullstack developers are always looking for tools that can help us build applications faster. Appsmith is a tool that allows to do exactly that, and after three months of trying, I think there's nothing that can go faster than that. With a huge set of limitations, of course, but nonetheless it's still valuable for a lot of situations. Let's dive in.

## What is Appsmith?

Appsmith is a no-code, open-source platform that allows to build applications using a drag-and-drop interface. The focus is around APIs and data (you have to provide the data somehow), but I think the level of customization is enough for most use cases. 

### Wait, what is no-code?

No-code is a movement that aims to allow people to build applications without writing code. It's not a new concept, but it's been gaining a lot of traction lately. The idea is to allow people to build applications without having to learn how to code. This is done by providing a visual interface that allows to build applications by dragging and dropping components, and connecting them together.

If you are a developer like me, I know what you're thinking: _there's NO WAAYYY I'm going to use such a tool, I am too good at &lt;insert your favourite framework here&gt; and nothing can beat me at this_. You are right: you are good and these tools are crap. But there are a few advantages that these tools bring to the table, which I'll try to enumerate here:

- They allow non-technical people to create UIs that work. By inference, they allow not-so-good developers to make stuff that works, with a decent quality.
- They are suitable for a limit set of appliations, but for those types, they offer an extremely fast development experience.
- You don't have to think about a lot of stuff - styling, bundling, deploying... other people has already taken those choices for you. 

### But what exactly is Appsmith?

It's a webapp. You access via [appsmith.com](https://www.appsmith.com/) and sign up. Once you're in, you're greeted with a dashboard with all your apps:

Creating an app is a matter of clicking "+ New", and then you're redirected to a page that looks like this:
