title: Why prehistory is fascinating me so much
description: >
  There is something that I am very curious about, let's say I am a nerd about: prehistory.

This is a programming blog, so I shouldn't be writing about **prehistory**.

For prehistory, we generally **identify the very long period that goes from the appearance of the first human (which here means the homo sapiens), 300.000 years ago, until the invention of writing, which happened some 5000 years ago**. From that moment, we could learn about our ancestors by simply reading what they wrote, given that we find a way to translate the text; but what before that? How can we learn about the first sapiens? What was their life? What were their problems?

I am no professor of archeology, and all you'll read in this post is just an enthusiastic write-out of something I am very passionate about. There may be imprecisions, wrong dates, no references, so don't send this article to anyone to prove your point :)

## Some cool facts about Sapiens

There are a few facts about first Sapiens that are incredibily interesting. Most of what we know is due to archeological findings, which allowed us to set dates and proove hipotesis.

* The very first Sapiens (which is the specie of you reading this) came out around **300.000 years ago**.
* When the Sapiens came out, they were not alone. We are thought at school that it's like "first Herectus then Neanderthal then Sapiens" while in practice it is waaay more complicated. When the Sapiens made its appearence in this world, other humans were around, and they were "similar", but not equal. **Sapiens, for a couple of milleniums, coexisted with Nehandertals and the lesser known Denisovans people.** Imagine walking around and see other *animals* that look like you, but they are not like you - different set of genes, reproduction between species is impossible, different set of dietary, habits... More like wolves and dogs.
* **Evidences show that Sapiens and Neanderthals didn't get along very well**. There are many mass graves of Neanderthals, and the fractures found on bones seem to suggest that they died after a tough encounter, perhaps to defend their territory.
* Some archeologists suggest that **the ability to cooperate and to imagine is what gave us the competitive advantage against other species**. Think about the paintings on caves, gathering all together around fires, talk about things that do not exist... before Sapiens, no animal could do that.
* Strangely enough, **today's Sapiens DNA is composed by a significant part of nehandertal's DNA**, which makes all of this even more weird. Our ancestors liked to interbreed.
* **The very first Sapiens were hunters-gatherers**. They probably hunted a lot - this explains the extintion of big mammals exactly when Sapiens arrived in their area - but they also moved around to *gather* fruits, vegetables and radixes directly from the woods. Some archeologists estimate that this task would require 4 hours per day on average, which means the rest of the day the Sapiens could enjoy some free time (yeah, let's paint the cave!).
* Invention of agriculture was probably what fucked us up. We were nomads, had to move a lot to gather food, and **in a couple of generations we became *slaves* of agriculture**, which required more effort, changed our diet drastically, and made us become sedentiary.

## The Indo-Europeans

There's another great group that caught my interest recently, and those are the **Indo-Europeans**. Basically, these guys around 3000 b.C. (so, 5000 years ago) started to spread out from modern Ukraine/Russia to Europe and India. We know about them because of their biggest lefting: their language.

A century ago some linguists noted that many languages shared too many things in common: how sanscrit can be  related to, say, latin? This made some scientists study the problem and it turns out it was a great attack surface for the problem. They found out so many things from the study of the words only, which was later matched with archeological findings.

* is it indo-european? When archeologists find a new text, the first thing they try to do is
* what can we infer from the absence or the presence of a word
* what existed before indo-europeans invasion
