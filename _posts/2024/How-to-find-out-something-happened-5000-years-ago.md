This is a programming blog, so I shouldn't be writing about this. But there is something that I am very curious about, let's say I am a nerd about it: prehistory. 

For prehistory, we generally identify the very long period that goes from the appearance of the first human (which here means the homo sapiens) until the invention of writing, which happened some 5000 years ago. From that moment, we could learn about our ancestors by simply reading what they wrote, given that we find a way to translate the text; but what before that? How can we learn about the first sapiens? What was their life? What were their problems? 

I am no professor of archeology, and all you'll read in this post is just an enthusiastic write-out of something I am very passionate about. There may be imprecisions, wrong dates, no references, so don't send this article to anyone to prove your point, it has this disclaimer right at the start :) 

## Some cool facts about Sapiens

There are a couple of facts that I learned about which are incredibily interesting. Most of what we know is due to archeological findings, which allowed us to set dates and proove hipotesis. 

* The very first sapiens (which is the specie of you reading this) came out around 300.000 years ago. 
* When the Sapiens came out, they were not alone. We are thought at school that it's like "first herectus then neanderthal then sapiens" while in practice it is waaay more complicated. When the sapiens made it appearence in this world, other humans were around, and they were "similar", but not equal. Imagine walking around and see other animals that look like you, but they are not you - different set of genes, reproduction between species is impossible, different set of dietary, habits... 
* Evidences show that sapiens and neanderthals didn't get along that well. There are many mass graves of neanderthals, and the fractures found on bones seem to suggest that they died after a tough encounter, perhaps to defend their territory. 
* Some archeologists suggest that the hability to cooperate and to imagine is what gave us the competitive advantage against other species. Think about the paintings on caves, gathering all together around fires.. before sapiens, no hanimal could do that.
* Strangely enough, the DNA we all have is composed of a significant part of nehandertal's DNA, which makes all of this very weird.
