I created this blog post mainly to hold a link to this excellent blog post: [How wine works](https://werat.dev/blog/how-wine-works-101/).

For those of you that don't know what WINE is, well it's a software that allows you to run Windows applications on linux machines. Many games, and Microsoft office, run out of the box with WINE. So you may think it's an emulator? No, it's not - actually it translates Windows system calls to native linux system calls.

I think we all knew how wine worked on a high level, but this blog post makes the extra effort to explain the extra mile. Also, I love when it shows the assembly code for linux and windows, there's so much to learn there, and sometimes I feel my life is too concentrated on high level languages and I am missing out the beauty of dealing with hardware directly.
