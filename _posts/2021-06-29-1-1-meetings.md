Do you want to know what's the most important meeting, the one none of us has ever done?   
It's **1:1 meeting**. 

_(If you've never heard of this meeting don't feel ashamed, i discovered it last year!)_

**The 1:1 meeting** (pronunced one-to-one) **happens regularly** (for example, every 14 days) **with your manager**. It's an _intimate_ meeting where you can discuss about everything. In this meeting, some managers may talk about work-related things only marginally, because there are other moments to do that. Some topics you can touch during this meeting are: 

* how are you
* your team
* your family
* the company
* our market, customers, stakeholders... 
* career, growth
* ...

It sounds crazy, expecially if you're italian, that **for an hour you can talk about human things among human beings**! Usually those meetings last between 30 and 60 minutes and it seems to be in the _Big Brother_ (tv show) confession room. 

Another beautiful thing: **during this hour you can ask your boss the same questions**, and sometimes it's nice to see he's having the same struggles you have, even though on different levels.

**During the years I worked for italian companies the 1:1 meeting has never happened**, if not occasionally. Indeed, in US companies the 1:1 meeting is scheduled every two weeks and, for what I understand, it's a common practice for big companies. I use it to ask my boss how's doing, what he's working on because his work is usually reflected on us after one-two months, so I've got some time to start studying them.

One note, by the way: **not everybody loves this genre of meetings**. I think they're fundamental to streighten the bond between the team member and the manager, and a side effect is that the whole team beneficts from it. Others may think it's a waste of time. So, if the manager itself doesn't _believe_ in the power of those meetings, those meetings will loose their benefits. 

To conclude, **my judgement is positive** and I wish you can organize the same policy in the companies you'll lead.
