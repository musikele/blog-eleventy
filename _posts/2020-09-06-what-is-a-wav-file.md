Short post: last week I came across a wonderful video about [how WAV files are made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udbA7u1zYfc), and how to create one from scratch, directly from NodeJS. The author, [Low Level Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC56l7uZA209tlPTVOJiJ8Tw), is really investing time creating quality content that is direct, clear, and coincise. Consider donating some money to his patreon if you find his videos useful. 

Before this video I had a general idea of how audio was represented, but when I saw that the author generated an entire playable wav file directly from the command line, writing byte by byte, I felt like I was learning something. And **this, my friends, is what I want to pay for: to feel the click inside my brain that I'm actually discovering** (...not learning) **something**.

I'd now like to know the second part of the story: how bits become analog signals that are converted to sound waves by audio cards? Is the physics behind this process understandable? If you have a good video for that, let me know.
