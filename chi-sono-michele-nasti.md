Hi! My name is Michele and this is my blog.

![/uploads/2015/01/mik-san-francisco.jpeg](/uploads/2015/01/mik-san-francisco.jpeg)

Here's a small list of things I do, or like:

- I am a **full stack programmer** even though my main specialization is in *frontend*. 
- As a consequence, my language of choice is **Javascript** (and *Typescript*) and **NodeJS**. 
- In the past I've also worked with **Java, Python, Php** and with frameworks like **Laravel**, **Spring**, **Django**.
- After graduating in 2013 *cum laude* in Computer Science here in Salerno University, I have worked for several companies as software engineer/consultant for the italian, swiss and US market.
- Some years ago I cofounded [DevDay](https://devday.it/), an association of Campania's developers that try to meet every month or two. 
- I am a remote worker since 2016, way before COVID :)
- I believe that Software is more about managing people than managing machines; for this reason, I am interested in **coordination and organizaton of teams**. 
- My english is well reflected in the artlicles of this blog, even though my pronunciation is heavily affected by my italianism.
- I am Italian and **I live in one of the most beautiful areas of Italy**, altough it's usually out of mainstream tours: things like Naples, Vesuvius, Amalfi, Sorrento, Pompei, Caserta, are all very close to me. 
- In my free time I play tennis and go hiking. I try to visit the beautiful italian Alps every year. I also used to play the guitar and bass in bands.
