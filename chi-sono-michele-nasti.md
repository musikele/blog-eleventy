Hi! My name is Michele and this is my blog.

![/uploads/2015/01/mik-san-francisco.jpeg](/uploads/2015/01/mik-san-francisco.jpeg)

Here's a small list of things I do, or like:

- I am a **full stack programmer** even though my main specialization is in _frontend_.
- As a consequence, my language of choice is **Javascript** (and _Typescript_) and **NodeJS**.
- In the past (and in the present) I've also worked with **Java, Python, PHP**, and frameworks like **Laravel**, **Spring**, and **Django**.
- After graduating in 2013 _cum laude_ in Computer Science at Salerno University (Italy), I have worked for several companies as a software engineer/consultant for the Italian, Swiss and US market.
- Some years ago I cofounded [DevDay](https://devday.it/), an association of Campania's developers that try to meet every month or two.
- I have been a remote worker since 2016, way before COVID ;)
- I believe that Software is more about managing people than managing machines; for this reason, I am interested in **team coordination and organization**.
My English is well reflected in the articles of this blog, even though my pronunciation is heavily affected by my Italianism.
- I am Italian and **I live in one of the most beautiful areas of Italy**, although it's usually out of mainstream tours: things like Naples, Vesuvius, Amalfi, Sorrento, Pompei, and Caserta are all very close to me.
- In my free time, I practice climbing and go hiking. I try to visit the beautiful Italian Alps every year. I also used to play the guitar and bass in bands.
